# COVID-19-tracker

- Covid-19 has turned out as a global pandemic infecting millions of people worldwide. In a densely populated country like   India the cumulative cases are rapidly increasing with time.
- Many prior studies have been accomplished to track the disease, growth prediction and possible management policies but they are not so effective considering the vast diversity of a country like India.
- In this study, we have shifted our focus on the number of infections in individual Indian states and try to create a model which can predict the number of infections for that state in the next 60-90 days.
